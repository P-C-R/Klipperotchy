This is a collection of tools that help some esoteric use cases of Klipper.

- Serial to Moonraker bridge: Allows to connect serial based software or devices to Klipper. Very useful to connect the Mosaic Palette 3 (Pro) in connected mode to Klipper. Can also serve to connect A klipper based laser to Lightburn in connected mode.

Few more tools on the way.
